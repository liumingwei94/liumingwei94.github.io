I am currently a PhD student in the School of Computer Science and Technology of Fudan University. My supervisor is Professor [Peng Xin](https://cspengxin.github.io/). My research direction is intelligent software development, focusing specifically on how to mine various software products, extract knowledge that is helpful for software development, and build a software development knowledge graph to assist developers and improve development efficiency. I am very interested in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, knowledge graphs, etc., and how to combine these technologies with software engineering research.
