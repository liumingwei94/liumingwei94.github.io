StackOverflow provides answers for a huge number of software development questions that are frequently encountered by developers. However, searching relevant questions in StackOverflow is not always easy using the keyword based search engine provided by StackOverflow. A software development question can be characterized by multiple attributes, such as, its concern (e.g., configuration problem, error handling, sample code, etc.), programming language, operating system, and involved middleware, framework, library and software technology. We propose a multi-faceted and interactive approach for searching StackOverflow questions (called MFISSO), which leverages these attributes of the questions. Our approach starts with an initial keyword-based query and extracts a multifaceted categorization from all the candidate questions using natural language processing and data mining. It then allows developers to iteratively refine the search results through an interactive process. We evaluated an implementation of MFISSO in a controlled experiments with 20 computing students, solving ten software development tasks using StackOverflow. The experiment shows that MFISSO can help developers find relevant questions faster and with higher accuracy.
